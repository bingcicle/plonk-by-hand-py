# PLONK by Hand

_Disclaimer: this is for my personal learning purposes while studying PLONK. Bugs and inaccuracies may be present._

Python implementation of [PLONK by Hand blog series](https://research.metastate.dev/plonk-by-hand-part-1/).

Currently only the prover is implemented (up to Part 2).

## Test

Tests are written for both part 1 and part 2 and try to test calculations where I think it makes sense.


```sh
python3 -m unittest discover
```
